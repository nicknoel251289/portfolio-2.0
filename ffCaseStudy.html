          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            It seems like every year, there is some new fitness trend taking over that is marketed as the “latest and greatest”.  With the rise of
            technology, being sedentary has also become the new norm.  Often times people with limited fitness knowledge are participating in
            trends and injuring themselves due to no basic fitness knowledge. Every day, there are more than 10,000 people treated in
            emergency rooms across the country for injuries stemming from exercise, sports, recreation, and immobility.
            <br />
            <br />
            FitForm is an application I designed that utilizes both fitness and technology to bring people back to their foundation. Users select different
            exercises to perform, then the application will use the smart phones camera to scan their bodies and assess their form against correct form.
            Depending on the results, each user will receive suggestions for corrective exercises that will help them achieve proper body mechanics. The
            better the form, the better the results, the less injuries there are.

          <h2>Initial Research</h2>

          <div class="research-data">

              <h4>The Goals</h4>
              <p>
              What I wanted to gain with these surveys is, an age demographic, to learn if people have a false perception of good posture during exercise,
              and <b><i>prove why</i></b> this <b><i>application is useful</i></b> to a majority of gym goers.
              </p>
              <h4>The Hypothesis</h4>
              <p>
              From my experience as an educator in movement science, it is my belief that a large portion of people either have a false interpretation of what correct
              motor mechanics are for the most basic compound exercises, do not have the foundation to start these lifts, or they do not realize they are improperly
              performing. If this returns true, it could easily help many people avoid injury and the byproducts that are attributed with it.
              </p>
              <h4>The Metric</h4>
              <p>
                This experiment used a questionnaire to categorize people into two groups: those who said they know proper form and those who did not.
                The questionnaire also included an age range in case there was a pattern with a specific age group. Once categorized,
                each person who answered the questionnaire performed a low barbell back squat using an Olympic 45lb barbell. Participants were graded on a 1 - 5 scale
                based off of proper limb positioning throughout the concentric and eccentric parts of the lift, where 4 and 5 are considered a success.
              </p>
              <h4>The Data</h4>
              <h5>Statistics for the group A - people who said they knew proper body mechanics for squatting</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>This group consisted of 65% of respondents</li>
                  <li>Out of the 65% that said they knew proper form, 61% failed to perform the squat correctly</li>
                  <li>Of the 61% of who failed, 76% were between the age of 18 and 34</li>
                </ul>

              <h5>Statistics for the group B - people who said they did NOT know proper body mechanics for squatting</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>This group consisted of 35% of the respondents</li>
                <li>Out of the 35% that did not know proper form, 71% failed to perform the squat correctly</li>
                <li>Of the 71% who failed, 28% were between the ages of 18 and 24</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>An additional survey showed:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>About 60% of people used free weights</li>
                <li>74% said they have never worked with a trainer</li>
                <li>75% of free weight users fell within the 18-34 years of age demographic</li>
                <li>75% of people who marked they had been injured in the gym were between the ages of 18 and 34.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The functional screening to determine exercise mastery was done to demonstrate if users were knowledgeable of proper motor mechanics during common
                lifts. The results were relatively shocking with over 65% of participants performing the exercise incorrectly. Chances are this pattern follows into
                other multi-joint/compound exercises. This survey, as well as my own experiences, are instrumental in demonstrating to possible FitForm users on the
                landing page the percentage of gym goers who have a false perception of what correct exercise posture is for even basic movements.

            FitForm will be available for everyone, therefore prior to building the initial wireframes it was important to understand the variety of people who will be
            using the app. So no matter what the users knowledge is, limits and capabilities, age, or any other variable, there will be something for them and it will be easy to use.
            The personas created were designed to depict people with various fitness levels, goals, and pain points. The personas also presented us with information
            from our users in regards to what types of features they were looking for on a fitness application.

            <p class="section-5p1">
              Because of the nature of only creating a landing page and because it was a new idea, it was important to know exactly what users would be
              specifically looking for. For this reason the layout was iterated multiple times to try to best deliver and highlight the areas thought to
              be most important. Based off of the current information and data I had, below were the initial three wireframes that I had produced.

          <h3>Questionnaire & A-B Testing</h3>
          <div class="abtesting">
              <h4>The Goal</h4>
              <p>
                First thing we did was run a questionnaire. The goal was to understand what possible items should be included on the front page site to
                increase likelihood of app downloads and what would deter people.
              </p>
              <h4>The Hypothesis</h4>
              <p>
                The belief is that certain elements or information displayed would generate more downloads. If this is true then a positive fluctuation in
                downloads should happen and if not then other variables are at play, such as social media marketing or search engine optimization.
              </p>
              <h4>The Metric</h4>
              <p>
                Next, I ran a simple A & B test. Because the content was the only variable I wanted to test, I generated two high fidelity wireframes. One
                wireframe contained the original design and the other contained the information gathered from the users via the questionnaire. What I told
                users before the test was that each site (wireframe) represented a mobile application that had the same functionality and concept. From
                here, I had a users look at each wireframe and determine which one they preferred to download and use. Using time and verbal/written
                feed back I was able to solidify a better layout.
              </p>
              <h4>The Data</h4>
              <h5>Combined data from both the questionnaire and the A & B wireframe testing:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>90% said that having a video <b>(point 1)</b> to see how the app works would increase their likelihood of downloading the app from the site or if the
                site allowed the visitor to try out the app before downloading it.</li>
                <li>90% said having a 'Featured in' and 'Reviews' section <b>(point 2)</b> increased the credibility and trustworthiness of the apps capabilities.</li>
                <li>20% answered they would dismiss the application and website if it was unable to relate with a problem they were having <b>(point 3)</b>.</li>
                <li>Finally, using a new group of people, I changed the 'Seven day free trial' button with, 'Try the app on your PC' <b>(point 4)</b> and almost 75% of people said they would click on 'Try the app on your PC" button over scrolling down.</li>
                <li>The average time looking at <b>wireframe A: 33 seconds</b> and the average time on <b>wireframe B: 16 seconds</b></li>
                <li>Out of both wireframes, <b>85% chose wireframe A</b> as their choice. Where as the remaining <b>15% chose wireframe B</b> or had no preference</li>
                <li>55% sanswered that a poor design would cause them to dismiss the website and app immediately. </li>
              </ul>

          <p class="section-8p2">
            It's hard to absolutely know if the data collected would be 100% accurate since testing was controlled and required people to voluntarily look at
            the pages and content. My assumption based on feedback from tests is, if a visitor were to land on the page with a button that allows you try the
            product now, along with user generated content, this would ultimately lead to higher retention time, a more trustworthier app, and an increase in
            app store visits, thus potentially increasing application downloads. In the future it would be great to be able to real-time test the site and see
            the variation in time spent on the site versus the controlled test, number of downloads, and how long each piece of content was viewed. Ultimately
            this was successful.
