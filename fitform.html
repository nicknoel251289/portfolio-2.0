        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
          It seems like every year, there is some new fitness trend taking over that is marketed as the
          “latest and greatest”. With the rise of technology, being sedentary has also become the new
          norm. Often times people with limited fitness knowledge are participating in trends and injuring
          themselves due to no basic fitness knowledge. Every day, there are more than 10,000 people treated
          in emergency rooms across the country for injuries stemming from exercise, sports, recreation, and
          immobility.
          <br>
          <br>
          FitForm is an application I designed that utilizes both fitness and technology to bring people
          back to their foundation. Users select different exercises to perform, then the application will
          use the smart phones camera to scan their bodies and assess their form against correct form.
          Depending on the results, each user will receive suggestions for corrective exercises that will
          help them achieve proper body mechanics. The better the form, the better the results, the less
          injuries there are.

        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>

        <h3>The Goals</h3>
        <p>
          What I wanted to gain with these surveys is, an age demographic, to learn if people have a
          false perception of good posture during exercise, and prove why this application is useful to
          a majority of gym goers.
        </p>

        <h3>The Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          From my experience as an educator in movement science, it is my belief that a large portion of
          people either have a false interpretation of what correct motor mechanics are for the most basic
          compound exercises, do not have the foundation to start these lifts, or they do not realize they
          are improperly performing. If this returns true, it could easily help many people avoid injury
          and the byproducts that are attributed with it.
        </p>

        <h3>The Metrics</h3>
        <p>
          This experiment used a questionnaire to categorize people into two groups: those who said they
          know proper form and those who did not. The questionnaire also included an age range in case
          there was a pattern with a specific age group. Once categorized, each person who answered the
          questionnaire performed a low barbell back squat using an Olympic 45lb barbell. Participants
          were graded on a 1 - 5 scale based off of proper limb positioning throughout the concentric
          and eccentric parts of the lift, where 4 and 5 are considered a success.
        </p>

        <h3>The Data</h3>
        <h4>Statistics for the group A - people who said they knew proper body mechanics for squatting:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This group consisted of 65% of respondents</li>
          <li>Out of the 65% that said they knew proper form, 61% failed to perform the squat correctly</li>
          <li>Of the 61% of who failed, 76% were between the age of 18 and 34</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Statistics for the group B - people who said they did NOT know proper body mechanics for squatting</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This group consisted of 35% of the respondents</li>
          <li>Out of the 35% that did not know proper form, 71% failed to perform the squat correctly</li>
          <li>Of the 71% who failed, 28% were between the ages of 18 and 24</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>An additional survey showed:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>About 60% of people used free weights</li>
          <li>74% said they have never worked with a trainer</li>
          <li>75% of free weight users fell within the 18-34 years of age demographic</li>
          <li>75% of people who marked they had been injured in the gym were between the ages of 18 and 34.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The functional screening to determine exercise mastery was done to demonstrate if users were
           knowledgeable of proper motor mechanics during common lifts. The results were relatively shocking
           with over 65% of participants performing the exercise incorrectly. Chances are this pattern follows
           into other multi-joint/compound exercises. This survey, as well as my own experiences, are instrumental
           in demonstrating to possible FitForm users on the landing page the percentage of gym goers who have a
           false perception of what correct exercise posture is for even basic movements.

        <p>
          FitForm will be available for everyone, therefore prior to building the initial wireframes
          it was important to understand the variety of people who will be using the app. So no matter
          what the users knowledge is, limits and capabilities, age, or any other variable, there will
          be something for them and it will be easy to use. The personas created were designed to
          depict people with various fitness levels, goals, and pain points. The personas also presented
          us with information from our users in regards to what types of features they were looking for
          on a fitness application.

        <h2>ITERATION & TESTING</h2>
        <p>
          Because of the nature of only creating a landing page and because it was a new idea,
          it was important to know exactly what users would be specifically looking for. For
          this reason the layout was iterated multiple times to try to best deliver and highlight
          the areas thought to be most important. Based off of the current information and data I
          had, below were the initial three wireframes that I had produced.
        </p>

        <h4>Of the three wireframes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>45% chose wireframe <b>A</b></li>
          <li>40% chose wireframe <b>B</b></li>

      <div class="questionnair-ab-testing-container">
        <h2>QUESTIONNAIRE & A-B TESTING</h2>
        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        <p>
          First thing we did was run a questionnaire. The goal was to understand what possible
          items should be included on the front page site to increase likelihood of app downloads
          and what would deter people.
        </p>

        <h3>The Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          The belief is that certain elements or information displayed would generate more downloads.
          If this is true then a positive fluctuation in downloads should happen and if not then other
          variables are at play, such as social media marketing or search engine optimization.
        </p>

        <h3>The Metrics</h3>
        <p>
          Next, I ran a simple A & B test. Because the content was the only variable I wanted to test,
          I generated two high fidelity wireframes. One wireframe contained the original design and the
          other contained the information gathered from the users via the questionnaire. What I told users
          before the test was that each site (wireframe) represented a mobile application that had the same
          functionality and concept. From here, I had a users look at each wireframe and determine which
          one they preferred to download and use. Using time and verbal/written feed back I was able to
          solidify a better layout.
        </p>

        <h3>The Data</h3>
        <h4>Combined data from both the questionnaire and the A & B wireframe testing:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            90% said that having a video <b>(point 1)</b> to see how the app works would increase their likelihood
            of downloading the app from the site or if the site allowed the visitor to try out the app before
            downloading it.
          </li>
          <li>
            90% said having a 'Featured in' and 'Reviews' section <b>(point 2)</b> increased the credibility and
            trustworthiness of the apps capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            20% answered they would dismiss the application and website if it was unable to relate with a
            problem they were having <b>(point 3)</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, using a new group of people, I changed the 'Seven day free trial' button with, 'Try the
            app on your PC' <b>(point 4)</b> and almost 75% of people said they would click on 'Try the app on your
            PC" button over scrolling down.
          </li>
          <li>
            The average time looking at <b>wireframe A: 33 seconds</b> and the average time on <b>wireframe B: 16 seconds</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Out of both wireframes, <b>85% chose wireframe A</b> as their choice. Where as the remaining <b>15% chose wireframe
            B</b> or had no preference
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>55%</b> answered that a <b>poor design</b> would cause them to <b>dismiss the website and app immediately</b>.
          </li>

        <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
        <p>
          It's hard to absolutely know if the data collected would be 100% accurate since testing was
          controlled and required people to voluntarily look at the pages and content. My assumption based
          on feedback from tests is, if a visitor were to land on the page with a button that allows you
          try the product now, along with user generated content, this would ultimately lead to higher
          retention time, a more trustworthier app, and an increase in app store visits, thus potentially
          increasing application downloads. In the future it would be great to be able to real-time test
          the site and see the variation in time spent on the site versus the controlled test, number of
          downloads, and how long each piece of content was viewed. Ultimately this was successful.
