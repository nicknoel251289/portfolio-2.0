          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Being user generated, the site offers field and store directory, product reviews, a market for buying, selling, and
            trading, a place to organize events, and a great place to share information,  pictures and videos.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
              Being a solo project, I did everything from the user interviews, user stories, creating the personaâ€™s, site mapping and
              flow charts, to iterating and testing of wireframes and mockups, all the way up to the prototype version. Oh, and I also
              did the rebranding of the logo.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="section-2b">
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>After gathering user feedback from interviews, the primary goals of the redesign and rebrand were to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Focus on allowing users to find content faster; increasing user efficiency</li>
              <li>Allow users a better way to save, follow and favorite threads</li>
              <li>Visually and mentally, create a more comprehensive design layout</li>
              <li>Update the sites appearance with a more modern and clean look</li>
              <li>Give users a better option for buying, selling, and trading</li>
              <li>Give users a way to create events</li>

          <h2>Initial Research</h2>

          <div class="initial-research">
          <p class="p1">
            The first test is a survey made to know how the site is being interacted with and understand what the opiniions of the users were. Knowing what areas are
            being used most will allow me to test them and to focus on them specifically to render a better user experience. The second test used was to gauge how
            efficient the site functions overall. Using time and verbal feedback as measurement, testing navigation to different sections of the site will open up
            potential issues and will set a baseline when checking the disparity between the old and redesign down the road.
          </p>
            <h3>Survey</h3>
          <p>
            The survey consisted of asking questions about what <b>part of the site they used most</b> and if that part of the site was created well and served its purpose.
            The feedback gathered displayed the following:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>77% of respondants said they have used the buying, selling, and trading sub-forum</li>
              <li>Almost 100% said they have used it to review products or have given a review</li>
              <li>43.3% Use the site to schedule events, team practices, or tryouts</li>
              <li>15.5% of people said they have posted video or pictures of events and nearly 100% have said they have used the forums to look at them</li>
              <li>22.6% consistently (weekly) use the forums for paintball news</li>
              <li>100% of people have added a friend to their buddy list</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>The most mentioned problems with the site were:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Viewing/finding a buddies profile</li>
              <li>Finding self-created thread(s)</li>
              <li>Navigating through a thread in BST (Buying, Selling, Trading - a user coming to potentially buy products from another user has no easy way of knowing if that product has been sold)</li>
              <li>Organizing events</li>
              <li>No way of creating poles for surveying</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Based off the responses, it was quite simple to narrow down what areas needed improving. But to understand if my redesign would be successful, I wanted to get a
              baseline of the original site.
            </p>
            <h3>Efficiency Test</h3>
            <p>
              Using a scale of one through ten, I invited multiple people ranging from very experienced, a ten, to some experience, to no experience at all and
              used time as well as verbal feedback as a way of gauging efficiency.
            </p>
            <h5>Test 1 - find your account</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>80% of people took over 2 minutes to do</li>
              <li>30% of people did not finish</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Most peoples verbal feedback communicated very clearly that they were unable to find how to access their account. Most were able to eventually find it
              through radom clicking on the navigation bar - located under User CP (User Control Panel) and once there, under settings & options.
            </p>
            <h5>Test 2 - Add someone to your buddy list</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>The average time it took to complete the test was 2 minutes and 24 seconds</li>
              <li>20% of people did not finish</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Most people said that they did not know how to specifically find another user at first. The 'universal' search bar did nothing for them. Most couldn't understand
              why the search bar for finding and adding another user is located inside their control panel.
            </p>
            <h5>Test 3 - Favorite/Follow a thread</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>The average time it took to complete the test was 2 minutes and 43 seconds</li>
              <li>50% took over 4 minutes</li>
              <li>20% of people did not finish</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It was obvious that testers who had more experience were able to do this task with lesser difficulty, but all responded by saying that the task should not of been
              as difficult as it was. It was also said that the amount of hypertext made the task much more confusing. Thus the people with less forum experience struggled with
              this task often getting lost.
            <br />
            <br />
              Among bad user feedback on the original site, one of the other large complications that hindered the users experience was the sites search
              system. Between data entries, unless you were a paying memeber, there was a 30 second lockout before searching again.

            PbNation is a sport tailored mainly to a male audience between ages 12 and 24 but does include females and people of all ages. For this reason, personas were made to resemble this demgographic.
            Making sure every page I redesigned, or a new feature that I was building into the site, was built to the users expectations. For this reason and because of the shear size of the site, having
            the personas to refer back to was very useful.

              <li><b>100%</b> of people <b>completed</b> this task whereas before, 30% of testers did not finish.</li>
              <li>Average time original: <b>121 second (2 minutes and 1 second)</b></li>
              <li>Average time redesign: <b>1.9 seconds</b></li>
            </ul>
          <p>Most people found the location that it was in was much more typical of where you would normally find your account or account settings.</p>
          <h5>Test 2 - Add someone to your buddy list</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>100%</b> of people <b>completed</b> this task whereas before, 20% of testers did not finish.</li>
              <li>Average time original: <b>144 seconds (2 minutes and 24 seconds)</b></li>
              <li>Average time redesign: <b>39 seconds</b></li>
            </ul>
          <p>Naturally, the people with more experience were able to complete the task quicker. 80% of people used the search bar to complete this task. The overall feedback from most testers was very similar,
            and as one tester stated, 'A universal search bar should be UNIVERSAL unlike the one on the original site.'
          </p>
          <h5>Test 3 - Favorite/Follow a thread</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>100%</b> of people <b>completed</b> this task whereas before, 20% of testers did not finish.</li>
              <li>Average time original: <b>163 seconds (2 minutes and 43 seconds)</b></li>
              <li>Average time redesign: <b>35.4 seconds</b></li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            Clearly from the results, the redesign was successful as a whole. Having cut the recorded times in half is a ridiculous improvement in efficiency but also goes to show why maintaining
            a site is so crucial.

          <h2>Preference Testing</h2>

          <p>
            Once the sites functionality and efficiency were addressed, I focused on running preference tests for visual design. Having feedback grom a group of people gave a good concensus on what
            was working and what was not working. The goal for this was to maintain a clean and professional look but add a touch color and character. It was important to have comprehensive
            navigational paths and also represent the world of paintball. Below are parts of the project that were preference tested.

              <li><b>iteration B</b> 82% said a lighter navigation bar balanced the site out where as before it felt heavier using a darker color</li>
              <li><b>iteration C</b> 100% thought having the white background container helped keep the content the main focus</li>

          <p>
            The original logo is clearly out-dated and needed an overhaul. While deciding on the proper color palette, I went ahead and gave the PbNation logo a makeover. Below is
            an overview of the progression as it was iterated along with the color. The <b>first 3 are a primary</b> design and the <b>last 3 are a secondary</b> design.

            Successfully implementing an improved, more functional, and more efficient site, I believe would make a positive change for users. It brings together
            some of the sites older elements with some newer ones but also allows the user to engage with the content more by reducing wait time, increasing site
             spatial awareness, and as an extra, improving visitor retention time.

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <p>
            As a large project, the redesign of <a href="http://www.pbnation.com/forum.php" target="_blank">PbNation</a> has brought many challenges to the table and many lesson. One of which is how important testing, reiterating, retesting and reiterating over and over for the best possible results, is.
            Which only holds true if you are testing the right variables. Thus, bringing me to another great lesson; knowing the right variables to test for and when to test for them. Although, this project was pretty
            straight forwards, having read a lot about UX testing brought me a lot of insight.
            It also showed what programs are more superior to handle large multi-page projects in an efficient manner. There were numerous pages and although Adobe Photoshop for mockups is very good, it is inferior to something like Adobe XD.
            Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience testing what worked and what didn't, researching and understanding the users of PbNation, as well as redesigning the logo.
