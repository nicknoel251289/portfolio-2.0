        <p>
          Being user generated, the site offers field and store directory, product reviews, a market for buying, selling,
          and trading, a place to organize events, and a great place to share information, pictures and videos.

          <h2>ROLE</h2>
          <p>
            Being a solo project, I did everything from the user interviews, user stories, creating the personaâ€™s,
            site mapping and flow charts, to iterating and testing of wireframes and mockups, all the way up to the
            prototype version. Oh, and I also did the rebranding of the logo.

          <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
          <h4>Primary goals of the project after gathering user feedback were:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Focus on allowing users to find content faster; increasing user efficiency</li>
            <li>Allow users a better way to save, follow and favorite threads</li>
            <li>Visually and mentally, create a more comprehensive design layout</li>
            <li>Update the sites appearance with a more modern and clean look</li>
            <li>Give users a better option for buying, selling, and trading</li>

        <h2>INITIAL RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>
          The first test is a survey made to know how the site is being interacted with and understand what the
          opiniions of the users were. Knowing what areas are being used most will allow me to test them and to
          focus on them specifically to render a better user experience. The second test used was to gauge how
          efficient the site functions overall. Using time and verbal feedback as measurement, testing navigation
          to different sections of the site will open up potential issues and will set a baseline when checking
          the disparity between the old and redesign down the road.
        </p>

        <!-- Surveys -->
        <h3>SURVEY</h3>
        <p>
          The survey consisted of asking questions about what part of the site they used most and if that part
          of the site was created well and served its purpose.
        </p>
        <h4>The feedback gathered displayed the following:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>77% of respondants said they have used the buying, selling, and trading sub-forum</li>
          <li>Almost 100% said they have used it to review products or have given a review</li>
          <li>43.3% Use the site to schedule events, team practices, or tryouts</li>
          <li>15.5% of people said they have posted video or pictures of events and nearly 100% have said they have used the forums to look at them</li>
          <li>22.6% consistently (weekly) use the forums for paintball news</li>
          <li>100% of people have added a friend to their buddy list</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The most mentioned problems with the site were:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Viewing/finding a buddies profile</li>
          <li>Finding self-created thread(s)</li>
          <li>Navigating through a thread in BST (Buying, Selling, Trading - a user coming to potentially buy products from another user has no easy way of knowing if that product has been sold)</li>
          <li>Organizing events</li>
          <li>No way of creating poles for surveying</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Based off the responses, it was quite simple to narrow down what areas needed improving. But to
          understand if my redesign would be successful, I wanted to get a baseline of the original site.
        </p>

        <!-- Efficiency test -->
        <h3>Efficiency Test</h3>
        <p>
          Using a scale of one through ten, I invited multiple people ranging from very experienced, a
          ten, to some experience, to no experience at all and used time as well as verbal feedback as
          a way of gauging efficiency.
        </p>

          <h4>Test 1 - find your account</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>80% of people took over 2 minutes to do</li>
            <li>30% of people did not finish</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Most peoples verbal feedback communicated very clearly that they were unable to find how to
            access their account. Most were able to eventually find it through radom clicking on the
            navigation bar - located under User CP (User Control Panel) and once there, under settings & options.
          </p>

          <h4>Test 2 - Add someone to your buddy list</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The average time it took to complete the test was 2 minutes and 24 seconds</li>
            <li>20% of people did not finish</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Most people said that they did not know how to specifically find another user at first. The 'universal'
            search bar did nothing for them. Most couldn't understand why the search bar for finding and adding
            another user is located inside their control panel.
          </p>

          <h4>Test 3 - Favorite/Follow a thread</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The average time it took to complete the test was 2 minutes and 43 seconds</li>
            <li>50% took over 4 minutes</li>
            <li>20% of people did not finish</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It was obvious that testers who had more experience were able to do this task with lesser difficulty,
            but all responded by saying that the task should not of been as difficult as it was. It was also said
            that the amount of hypertext made the task much more confusing. Thus the people with less forum experience
            struggled with this task often getting lost.
            <br>
            <br>
            Among bad user feedback on the original site, one of the other large complications that hindered the
            users experience was the sites search system. Between data entries, unless you were a paying memeber,
            there was a 30 second lockout before searching again.

          PbNation is a sport tailored mainly to a male audience between ages 12 and 24 but does include females
          and people of all ages. For this reason, personas were made to resemble this demgographic. Making sure
          every page I redesigned, or a new feature that I was building into the site, was built to the users
          expectations. For this reason and because of the shear size of the site, having the personas to refer
          back to was very useful.

        <h2>COMPARATIVE RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>
          After building the redesigned site and iterating it multiple times. I finally was at a point where
          I could rerun the efficiency test. To ensure as much accuracy as possible, I had the same people
          come back to do the exact same tasks but on the redesign.
        </p>

        <h3>Efficiency Test II</h3>
        <p>
          After the first test was complete, looking at the feedback and time recorded, it was an obvious right
          away that the changes were big.
        </p>

        <h4>Test 1 - find your account</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>100% of people completed this task whereas before, 30% of testers did not finish.</li>
          <li>Average time original: 121 second (2 minutes and 1 second)</li>
          <li>Average time redesign: 1.9 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Most people found the location that it was in was much more typical of where you would normally find
          your account or account settings.
        </p>

        <h4>Test 2 - Add someone to your buddy list</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>100% of people completed this task whereas before, 20% of testers did not finish.</li>
          <li>Average time original: 144 seconds (2 minutes and 24 seconds)</li>
          <li>Average time redesign: 39 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Naturally, the people with more experience were able to complete the task quicker. 80% of people used
          the search bar to complete this task. The overall feedback from most testers was very similar, and as
          one tester stated, 'A universal search bar should be UNIVERSAL unlike the one on the original site.'
        </p>

        <h4>Test 3 - Favorite/Follow a thread</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>100% of people completed this task whereas before, 20% of testers did not finish.</li>
          <li>Average time original: 163 seconds (2 minutes and 43 seconds)</li>
          <li>Average time redesign: 35.4 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Clearly from the results, the redesign was successful as a whole. Having cut the recorded times in
          half is a ridiculous improvement in efficiency but also goes to show why maintaining a site is so
          crucial.

          Once the sites functionality and efficiency were addressed, I focused on running preference tests for
          visual design. Having feedback grom a group of people gave a good concensus on what was working and
          what was not working. The goal for this was to maintain a clean and professional look but add a touch
          color and character. It was important to have comprehensive navigational paths and also represent the

          The original logo is clearly out-dated and needed an overhaul. While deciding on the proper color palette,
          I went ahead and gave the PbNation logo a makeover. Below is an overview of the progression as it was iterated
          along with the color. The first 3 are a primary design and the last 3 are a secondary design.

        <p>
          Successfully implementing an improved, more functional, and more efficient site, I believe would make a
          positive change for users. It brings together some of the sites older elements with some newer ones but
          also allows the user to engage with the content more by reducing wait time, increasing site spatial
          awareness, and as an extra, improving visitor retention time.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
          As a large project, the redesign of PbNation has brought many challenges to the table and many lesson.
          One of which is how important testing, reiterating, retesting and reiterating over and over for the best
          possible results, is. Which only holds true if you are testing the right variables. Thus, bringing me to
          another great lesson; knowing the right variables to test for and when to test for them. Although, this
          project was pretty straight forwards, having read a lot about UX testing brought me a lot of insight. It
          also showed what programs are more superior to handle large multi-page projects in an efficient manner.
          There were numerous pages and although Adobe Photoshop for mockups is very good, it is inferior to
          something like Adobe XD. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience testing what worked and what didn't,
          researching and understanding the users of PbNation, as well as redesigning the logo.
