          <p>
            As a company that has sparked more creativity out of me, I took pleasure on my own, to recreate
            and develope (still working on) a landing page based around their company. It gave me the
            opportunity to work with Adobe XD and a chance to hone in on vanilla JavaScript, as I wanted
            to really impliment more transitions and interactivity to the page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Again, this project was done for fun and at my own will. What you see are my own interpretations
            and ideas.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
          This was a great project to spend more time focusing on the basics of HTML5 and CSS3.
          When I finally started to write the markup, I wanted to take my time to really try and learned
          to use less but more efficient code. I was able to really understand how both CSS grid and
          Flexbox are used to compliment each other.
          <br>
          <br>
          During this project, I also took time to learn a few more aspects of JavaScript with event listeners.
          Like CSS grid and Flexbox, I learned how the requestAnimationFrame method compliments event listeners
          very well.
