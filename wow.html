            With the coming release of Battle for Azeroth, the next upcoming expansion for the game
            World of Warcraft, most players are at a point where they are trying to figure out what
            class they want to have as a main character. What I did for fun was create a class picker
            questionnaire.
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason for choosing this project is because it combines both my interests in World
            of Warcraft and would allow me to practice using JavaScript, a language I desire to be
            extremely fluent in.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
          One of the hardest aspects of this project was the attention to detail and the amount of attention needed.
          Althought, I was able to complete this project within a couple of days, it took a bit of self-advocacy and
          reliance to really get a grasp on how things were working. Overall, I was able to complete the project and
          with a better grasp of the methods and loops used.
